This project (SICAssemblyParser) is a commandline driven implementation of an Assembly Code file parser
that can be used for the SIC System Software described in the textbook System Software by Leland L. Beck, 3rd Edition.
The project was developed and tested in CLion 2024.3. It has not been tested on any other IDE. 
Examples of the Assembly Code that was used in testing can be found in the Assembly Code folder.
The parser will supply the label, operand, and opcode for each line of code and will identify 
errors with the format of the Assembly Code. This project allowed me to practice and refine my C coding skills.
A full implementation of the SIC System Software was completed in Python and can be found under 
the SIC_System_Software repository on this profile.
